! WARNING
! This file contains a regexp list of trigger words and phrases that an individual might find offensive.
! It is used to prevent web pages that contain these words and phases being shown to people
! who might be offended.
! It is not intended to upset anyone.  Exercise caution when reading.
!
!
! Format:
! A comma separated list.
! Lines starting with a ! are comments and are ignored
! (e.g. redundant triggers that you don't want to lose).
! Blank lines are ignored.
! There are three types of data lines:
!     1. Version:
!         A line with 'Version' as the first field is assumed to have some sort of arbitary
!         version number or phrase as the second field that you can use to check the correct
!         version of the trigger file has been loaded.
!     2. Trigger definition:
!         Fields are assumed to be in the order: 
!             trigger regexp, modifier, your reference (optional), your comment (optional)
!         Anything after the first 3 fields is ignored.
!         regexp is a regular expression, and modifier is a character that alters how the
!         regexp behaves, See: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_regexp.asp
!         'your reference' is your own unique arbitary reference that allows the trigger to be refered
!         to to a third party without revealing the trigger itself.
!     3. Test definition:
!          A line with 'Test' as the first field is assumed to have a test to ensure the definition and 
!          operation of a regexp has been understood.  Fields are assumed to be in the order:
!              Test, string, result, your comment (optional)
!         Anything after the first 3 fields is ignored.
!         string is any word/phrase you want to use the test the regexp.
!         result is one of 'match' or 'fail', 'match' indicates that you expect the trigger to be found in 
!         the string.
!         When the regexps are loaded into the browser extension, they will be matched against the
!         strings and if the result is not as expected a warning will be raised.
!         A test of a regexp must come immediately after the line that defines the regexp. 
!         Not all regexps are expected to have a test, the test facility is there to check the more complex
!         ones.
!         A regexp can have multiple tests.
